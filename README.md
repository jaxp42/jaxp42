  <summary>‚ùì About me</summary>
  <br />
 
 <p>
  I'm a freelance full-stack developer based in Spain. I primarily work with Java, Javascript, Groovy, HTML, CSS, SQL and others daily. But I have experience with       languages like Typescript, PHP, Python and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. I also do work and have knowledge of agile methodologies like Scrum.

  Currently, I'm getting more involved in the development of plugins for Atlassian products, mostly Jira and Confluence, both server and cloud. Besides, I like            spending some time working on my projects, learning new technologies or improving my skills.
